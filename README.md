# Artificial Intelligence – Practical Assignments

This repository contains all the practical assignments completed for the Artificial Intelligence course. Each assignment focuses on core AI concepts, algorithms, and implementations, ranging from basic search techniques to advanced machine learning models.

## 📌 Contents

* Implementation of fundamental AI algorithms
* Search techniques (DFS, BFS, A*, etc.)
* Knowledge representation and reasoning
* Machine learning models and evaluation
* Problem-solving using Python
* Practical experiments with datasets
* Well-structured code with explanations and outputs

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized, organized collection of AI practicals that demonstrates hands-on understanding of AI concepts, strengthens coding skills, and helps in academic submission or personal portfolio building.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy, Pandas**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
* Other AI/ML-related libraries as required

## 📁 Structure

Each practical is placed in a separate folder or notebook with:

* Code implementation
* Problem statement
* Output screenshots (if needed)
* Explanation & observations

Feel free to explore, run, and learn from the implementations!
